declarative programming should be used for building user interfaces and wiring software components, while imperative programming is excellent for expressing business logic


Decouple DOM manipulation from application logic. This improves the testability of the code. Regard application testing as equal in importance to application writing. Testing difficulty is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
Decouple the client side of an application from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
Guide developers through the entire journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.
Angular follows the MVC pattern of software engineering and encourages loose coupling between presentation, data, and logic components. Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditional server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the backend is reduced, leading to much lighter web applications.
