\chapter{Summary}

This work provides tools to allow the model and reproducible simulation results to be directly embedded or linked into an interactive figure in online articles.
Once the full potential of Carbon is realized, scientists may track and follow the activities of a large number of others regardless of location or affiliation.
This unprecedented transparency can radically improve collaboration and learning in systems biology.
Moreover, simulation and analysis of computational models will now be accessible to a much wider audience.
